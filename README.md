# COMP310_A2
Printer Spooler

This was the second assignment in COMP 310/ECSE 427 - Operating Systems, taught by Professor Muthucumaru Maheswaran at McGill University in the Winter 2016 semester.

Client program runs in the following way:
Takes in a two positive integers which correspond to the ID, as well as the job duration (in time). I have set up a default ID of 0 and time of 1 for improperly formatted arguments

Printer program runs in the following way:
Takes in a single positive integer argument which corresponds to the length of the queue, otherwise it is hardcoded with a value of 10.

The project description (given by Professor Maheswaran) is also included in file "mini_PA2.pdf".
